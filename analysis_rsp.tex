\subsubsection{Portal}

\textbf{P-101}: User interface cone search on the object catalog, review the results overplotted on the HIPS map.

\textbf{P-102}: Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL) cone search on the object catalog with magnitude constraints, create a color-magnitude diagram in the results view.

\textbf{P-103}: Create exploratory color plots of different trans-Neptunian object (TNO) populations and perform statistical analyses to determine potential correlations. 

\textbf{P-201}: Perform an LSST light curve classification (e.g., stars vs quasars vs AGNs) using Portal tools, leveraging visualization features to distinguish populations.

\textbf{P-301}: Query annual data releases and deepCoadds for overlaps with other datasets, and generate publication-quality plots of data and images.

\textbf{P-302}: Query survey property maps and cross-correlate them with shape and photo-z catalogs to investigate cosmic shear. Perform advanced filtering to optimize query performance.

\subsubsection{Notebook}

\textbf{N-101}:  Analyze light curves and create periodograms for selected targets, starting with provided templates and basic functionality.

\textbf{N-201}: Perform Point Spread Function (PSF) null tests for weak lensing analyses, querying PSF moments to compute residuals in sizes and shapes, and plotting them as a function of magnitude to examine systematic effects (e.g., the brighter-fatter effect).

\textbf{N-202}: Detect and characterize microlensing events across the sky, using advanced algorithms and external packages for computational support.

\textbf{N-301}: Run and compare different cluster-finding algorithms, assessing their performance using custom-defined metrics. Utilize batch processing resources for computationally intensive tasks.

\subsubsection{API}

\textbf{A-101}: Explore Rubin catalogs and metadata using basic API queries, and cross-match catalogs from Rubin and other surveys to study low-redshift Type Ia supernovae.

\textbf{A-102}: Monitor known strong lensing systems and discover new ones by performing API-based queries to measure time delays of multiply-imaged transients and quasars.

\textbf{A-201}: Verify the consistency of cosmological observables across dark energy probes by querying Rubin Web API data and performing basic statistical consistency checks.

\textbf{A-301}: Query galaxy shapes, positions, and photo-z catalogs to measure two-point correlation functions with external packages (\emph{e.g.}, Treecorr). Use the results for modeling and parameter sampling with access to batch resources.

\subsubsection{Multi-aspect}

\textbf{M-201}: Create exploratory plots and diagrams in the Portal to identify trends or interesting subsets, then use the Notebook Aspect for computationally intensive analyses and catalog queries.
