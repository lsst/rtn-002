{\bf User N1}: A time domain user with little experience in python and Jupyter Notebooks/Jupyter Lab, who is interested in light curves and periodograms of selected targets. 

{\bf User N2}:   A time domain user experienced with programming experience, including python and Jupyter Notebooks, who is interested in detection and characterization of microlensing events across the sky.

{\bf User N3}:   A static science user with little Jupyter experience wants to Perform Point Spread Function (PSF) null tests for weak lensing analyses: for example, they wish to query residual PSF sizes and plot them as function of magnitude to look for residuals of the brighter-fatter effect (e.g., Jarvis et al 2017).

{\bf User N4}:  An experienced static science user interested in running different cluster-finding algorithms and assessing their performances under different metrics. Might need the use of batch resources.
