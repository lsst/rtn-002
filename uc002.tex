{\bf Use Case:} 002 The CET Solves an Issue

{\bf Characteristic Information} \\
Trigger: The issue is identified by the Primary Actor. \\
Goal in Context: User submits Help Desk request for a potential Camera issue. \\
Primary Actor: A scientist within the project and/or the scientific user community of the Rubin Observatory. \\
Scope: Community Engagement Team \\
Level: Primary Task \\
Preconditions: Operations phase has started. \\
Success End Condition: The issue is resolved and the scientific performance of the Rubin Observatory is maintained or increased. \\
Failed End Condition: The issue is not resolved and the scientific performance of the Rubin Observatory is negatively impacted. \\

{\bf Main Success Scenario} \\
Step 1: Identify individuals with the relevant expertise.\\
Step 2: Understand the issue and how it threatens scientific performance.\\
Step 3: Define the importance and urgency of the issue.\\
Step 4: Develop a strategy to resolve the issue.\\
Step 5: Work to implement the resolution.\\
Step 6: Review and close the issue.\\

{\bf Extensions} \\
Alteration 1.1. IF  the issue evolves THEN new individuals with expertise are identified.\\
Alteration 1.2. IF  all identified individuals needed to resolve the issue are from the science user community THEN they may proceed without formally completing steps 2-5, but should still review and close the issue.\\
Alteration 2.1: IF the issue evades understanding THEN new individuals with expertise are identified.\\
Alteration 2.2. IF the issue does not threaten scientific performance THEN it may not require a resolution, and could be reviewed and closed after skipping steps 3, 4, and 5.\\
Alteration 3.1. IF the issue is deemed unimportant or non-urgent THEN it may not require a resolution, and could be reviewed and closed after skipping steps 3, 4, and 5.\\
Alteration 4.1: IF a strategy cannot be developed THEN return to steps 1-3.\\
Alteration 5.1: IF work to implement a resolution is not completed THEN return to step 4.\\
Alteration 6.1: IF the resolution does not pass review THEN return to step 4.\\

{\bf Sub-Variations} \\
Variation 5.1: As work proceeds, new (related) issues may be spawned as ?children?. \\

{\bf Related Information} (Optional) \\
Priority: {\it TBD as part of the main success scenario} \\
Performance Target: {\it the amount of time to resolve issues will be very issue-dependent} \\
Frequency: {\it  the frequency of different issue types will depend on the issue itself} \\
Superordinate Use Case:  \\
Subordinate Use Cases: \\
Channel to primary actor:  interactive communication \\
Secondary Actors: Rubin Observatory scientists and Rubin science community users \\
Channel to Secondary Actors: interactive communication \\
