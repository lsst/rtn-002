{\textbf{User P1}}: A user with little experience using portal-like websites who wants to make exploratory color plots of different TNO populations and perform statistical analyses on them to determine potential correlations. 

{\textbf{User P2}}: An experienced user (previous experience with e.g., MAST or IRSA) who will use the portal  LSST Light curve classification (stars vs quasars vs AGNs or other objects). 

{\textbf{User P3}}: A static science user with little portal experience looking for overlaps with other data sets by querying on annual data releases and deepCoadds. They want to produce publication-quality plots of data and images. 

{\textbf{User P4}}: An experienced static science user that wants to determine queries for survey property maps and cross-correlate them with shape and photo-z catalogs for cosmic shear investigations.
