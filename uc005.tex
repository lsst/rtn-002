{\bf Use Case:} 005 Science Platform Bug: A Help Desk Submission  \\

{\bf Characteristic Information} \\
Trigger: Help desk submission \\
Goal in Context: address bug in Rubin Science Platform (RSP)\\
Primary Actor: CST member \\
Scope: the science platform \\
Level: \\
Preconditions: The RSP is operating and has users.  Some ticketing system is operating.  The ticket has been submitted. \\
Success End Condition: The ticket is resolved by either: (1) solving user issue that is not actually a bug, or (2) identifying the bug and providing information to the RSP.  I guess the real success end condition is correcion of the bug, but more relevant for the CST team is probably providing a short-term workaround. \\
Failed End Condition: Bug is not able to be reproduced and no work around is available. \\

{\bf Main Success Scenario} \\
Step 1: CST confirms bug is reproducible. \\
Step 2: CST communicates bug to RSP developers. \\
Step 3: CST provides work-around to user. \\
Step 4: RSP developers fix bug. \\
Step 5: New RSP version rolled out. \\
