\textbf{Use Case:} 005 Science Platform Bug: A Help Desk Submission \\

\textbf{Characteristic Information} \\
\textbf{Trigger:} Help desk submission \\
\textbf{Goal in Context:} Address a bug in the Rubin Science Platform (RSP). \\
\textbf{Primary Actor:} CST member \\
\textbf{Scope:} The science platform \\
\textbf{Level:} \\
\textbf{Preconditions:} The RSP is operational and has active users. A ticketing system is functioning, and the ticket has been submitted. \\
\textbf{Success End Condition:} The ticket is resolved by either: (1) solving a user issue that is not actually a bug, or (2) identifying the bug and providing information to the RSP development team. While the ultimate success end condition is the correction of the bug, for the CST team, providing a short-term workaround is more immediately relevant. \\
\textbf{Failed End Condition:} The bug cannot be reproduced, and no workaround is available. \\

\textbf{Main Success Scenario} \\
Step 1: CST confirms that the bug is reproducible. \\
Step 2: CST communicates the bug to RSP developers. \\
Step 3: CST provides a workaround to the user. \\
Step 4: RSP developers fix the bug. \\
Step 5: A new RSP version is rolled out. \\
