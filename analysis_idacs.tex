\textbf{I-201}  Use GPU resources available at IDACs to train machine-learning algorithms (e.g., for galaxy classification) using PSF model parameters derived from LSST coadd PSF images.

\textbf{I-202}: Use high-performance computing resources and co-located datasets from external projects at IDACs to run object-finding algorithms (e.g., to identify galaxy clusters) independently developed by a science collaboration (e.g., algorithms developed by LSST DESC at NERSC).

\textbf{I-301} Leverage direct access to coadd and shear catalogs at NERSC or other supercomputing facilities to perform high I/O workflows, such as iterative analyses across large datasets.
Use parallelized HPC pipelines to compute two-point correlation functions, analyze tomographic data, calibrate photo-z measurements, and calculate covariances.
For example, this functionality can support weak lensing and galaxy clustering studies to estimate cosmological parameters and constrain cosmological models.
