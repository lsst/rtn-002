\textbf{I-201} Retrieve PSF cutouts from coadd images (e.g., using the Notebook Aspect of the RSP) to derive parameters of PSF models.
Use these parameters to train machine-learning-based algorithms for galaxy classification using GPU resources at IDACs.

\textbf{I-202}: Find galaxy clusters in LSST data using Rubin APIs and notebooks for exploratory analysis.
Download data to NERSC and run cluster-finding algorithms developed by LSST DESC, incorporating data from precursor surveys such as DECam and HSC.

\textbf{I-301} Using direct access to a copy of the coadd and shear catalogs at NERSC or other supercomputing facilities (which will require many iterations through the entire coadd catalogs with high I/O demands), measure weak lensing and galaxy clustering two-point correlation functions to estimate cosmological parameters and constrain cosmological models.
Analyze tomographic data, perform photo-z calibrations, and compute covariances using parallelized HPC pipelines and Rubin APIs.
