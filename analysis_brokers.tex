\textbf{B-101} Identify Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) and extreme AGN by constructing long-term light curves from difference images using forced photometry.  Combine host galaxy properties (e.g., mass, Start Formation Rate, etc) with TDE candidates to build a comprehensive classification.
\textbf{B-201}  Detect and characterize microlensing events by analyzing DIA images. Model light curves and assess crowding effects to estimate baseline magnitudes and object properties. 
\textbf{B-202} Classify periodic variable stars using a neural network. Improve classification algorithms with DR1 data and develop labeled datasets for future analyses.
