\textbf{B-101}: Use alert brokers to filter and prioritize LSST alerts in real-time based on user-defined criteria, such as brightness, location, or changes in brightness.

\textbf{B-102}: Set up watchlists within an alert broker to track objects of interest, receiving real-time notifications when they are detected in LSST data.

\textbf{B-201}: Cross-match real-time alerts with external catalogs to distinguish new discoveries from known objects.
Use the results to refine classifications or notify researchers of objects requiring follow-up.

\textbf{B-202}: Classify transient objects using photometric light curves, applying machine-learning algorithms or predefined classification schemes.
