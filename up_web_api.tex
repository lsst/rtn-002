{\bf User WA1}: A time domain user with no previous experience with Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL) queries who is interested in exploring what catalogs exist and which columns they contain for Rubin catalogs and catalogs from other surveys. They are interested in performing basic cross matching for low-redshift Type Ia supernovae studies. 

{\bf User WA2}: An experienced time domain user interested in discovery and characterization of variable strong lenses for potential follow up. They also want to monitor the list of existing strong lensing systems (cross matching with other lists). Eventually, the user will be interested in measuring time delays of multiply imaged transients and quasars. 

{\bf User WA3}: A static science user with little experience with the Web API aspect wants to check that measurements of cosmological observables from the various dark energy probes agree within expected uncertainties to check data consistency. 

{\bf User WA4}: An experienced static science user who wants to query shape and photo-z catalogs, measure two point correlation functions with an external package (\emph{e.g.}, 11Treecorr‚Äù) to produce a data vector. Then perform modeling and parameter sampling. This might need access to extra resources (batch processing).
